A \"Letter of Credit\" is used as an instrument for settlement of payment arising out of commercial transactions like sales/purchases. In such credit, a payment obligation arises only upon the fulfillment of specified conditions. For the bulk amount of order Letter of Credit must be used.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: This method will be applicable for large comercial order used in import &amp; export.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>2.
